    "home": "Reddit Content Policy\nReddit is a vast network of communities that are created, run, and populated by you, the Reddit users.Through these communities, you can post, comment, vote, discuss, learn, debate, support, and connect with people who share your interests, and we encourage you to find\u2014or even create\u2014your home on Reddit.While not every community may be for you (and you may find some unrelatable or even offensive), no community should be used as a weapon. Communities should create a sense of belonging for their members, not try to diminish it for others. Likewise, everyone on Reddit should have an expectation of privacy and safety, so please respect the privacy and safety of others.Every community on Reddit is defined by its users. Some of these users help manage the community as moderators. The culture of each community is shaped explicitly, by the community rules enforced by moderators, and implicitly, by the upvotes, downvotes, and discussions of its community members. Please abide by the rules of communities in which you participate and do not interfere with those in which you are not a member.Below the rules governing each community are the platform-wide rules that apply to everyone on Reddit. These rules are enforced by us, the admins.Reddit and its communities are only what we make of them together, and can only exist if we operate by a shared set of rules. We ask that you abide by not just the letter of these rules, but the spirit as well.RulesRule 1Remember the human. Reddit is a place for creating community and belonging, not for attacking marginalized or vulnerable groups of people. Everyone has a right to use Reddit free of harassment, bullying, and threats of violence. Communities and users that incite violence or that promote hate based on identity or vulnerability will be banned.Rule 2Abide by community rules. Post authentic content into communities where you have a personal interest, and do not cheat or engage in content manipulation (including spamming, vote manipulation, ban evasion, or subscriber fraud) or otherwise interfere with or disrupt Reddit communities.Rule 3Respect the privacy of others. Instigating harassment, for example by revealing someone\u2019s personal or confidential information, is not allowed. Never post or threaten to post intimate or sexually-explicit media of someone without their consent.Rule 4Do not share or encourage the sharing of sexual, abusive, or suggestive content involving minors. Any predatory or inappropriate behavior involving a minor is also strictly prohibited.Rule 5You don\u2019t have to use your real name to use Reddit, but don\u2019t impersonate an individual or an entity in a misleading or deceptive manner.Rule 6Ensure people have predictable experiences on Reddit by properly labeling content and communities, particularly content that is graphic, sexually-explicit, or offensive.Rule 7Keep it legal, and avoid posting illegal content or soliciting or facilitating illegal or prohibited transactions.Rule 8Don\u2019t break the site or do anything that interferes with normal use of Reddit.EnforcementWe have a variety of ways of enforcing our rules, including, but not limited toAsking you nicely to knock it offAsking you less nicelyTemporary or permanent suspension of accountsRemoval of privileges from, or adding restrictions to, accountsAdding restrictions to Reddit communities, such as adding NSFW tags or QuarantiningRemoval of contentBanning of Reddit communities",
    "harassment, bullying": "We do not tolerate the harassment, threatening, or bullying of people on our site; nor do we tolerate communities dedicated to this behavior. Reddit is a place for conversation, and in that context, we define this behavior as anything that works to shut someone out of the conversation through intimidation or abuse, online or off. Depending on the context, this can take on a range of forms, from directing unwanted invective at someone to following them from subreddit to subreddit, just to name a few. Behavior can be harassing or abusive regardless of whether it occurs in public content (e.g. a post, comment, username, subreddit name, subreddit styling, sidebar materials, etc.) or private messages/chat. Being annoying, downvoting, or disagreeing with someone, even strongly, is not harassment. However, menacing someone, directing abuse at a person or group, following them around the site, encouraging others to do any of these actions, or otherwise behaving in a way that would discourage a reasonable person from participating on Reddit crosses the line. To report Harassment, please visit this page .",
    "violence": "Rule 1: Remember the human. \u2026 Everyone has a right to use Reddit free of harassment, bullying, and threats of violence. Do not post content that encourages, glorifies, incites, or calls for violence or physical harm against an individual (including oneself) or a group of people; likewise, do not post content that glorifies or encourages the abuse of animals. We understand there are sometimes reasons to post violent content (e.g., educational, newsworthy, artistic, satire, documentary, etc.) so if you\u2019re going to post something violent in nature that does not violate these terms, ensure you provide context to the viewer so the reason for posting is clear. If your content is borderline, please use a NSFW tag. Even mild violence can be difficult for someone to explain to others if they open it unexpectedly. Some examples of violent content that would violate the Rule: Post or comment with a credible threat of violence against an individual or group of people. Post containing mass killer manifestos or imagery of their violence. Terrorist content , including propaganda. Post containing imagery or text that incites, glorifies, or encourages self-harm or suicide. Post that requests, or gives instructions on, ways to self-harm or commit suicide. Graphic violence, image, or video without appropriate context. Note that health misinformation, namely falsifiable health information that encourages or poses a significant risk of physical harm to the reader, also violates the Rule. To report Violent Content, please visit this page . What do I do if someone talks about seriously hurting themselves or is considering suicide? When you see a post or comment about suicidal feelings in a community, it can be overwhelming, and you may feel like you don\u2019t know what to do. But you can help, and there are resources available for you and the person you\u2019re worried about. Reddit has partnered with Crisis Text Line to provide redditors who may be considering suicide or seriously hurting themselves with support from trained Crisis Counselors.",
    "identity or vulnerability": "Rule 1: Remember the human. Reddit is a place for creating community and belonging, not for attacking marginalized or vulnerable groups of people. Everyone has a right to use Reddit free of harassment, bullying, and threats of violence. Communities and people that incite violence or that promote hate based on identity or vulnerability will be banned. Marginalized or vulnerable groups include, but are not limited to, groups based on their actual and perceived race, color, religion, national origin, ethnicity, immigration status, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, pregnancy, or disability. These include victims of a major violent event and their families. While the rule on hate protects such groups, it does not protect those who promote attacks of hate or who try to hide their hate in bad faith claims of discrimination. Some examples of hateful activities that would violate the rule: Subreddit community dedicated to mocking people with physical disabilities. Post describing a racial minority as sub-human and inferior to the racial majority. Comment arguing that rape of women should be acceptable and not a crime. Meme declaring that it is sickening that people of color have the right to vote. Additionally, when evaluating the activity of a community or an individual user, we consider both the context as well as the pattern of behavior.",
    "spamming": "Spam on Reddit is generally defined as repeated, unwanted, and/or unsolicited actions, whether automated or manual, that negatively affect Reddit users, Reddit communities, and/or Reddit itself. Spam is a violation of the Reddit User Agreement and Content Policy , punishable by content removal and temporary or permanent banning of your Reddit account. As spam-like behaviors evolve, Reddit will continue to adjust how we mitigate and prevent the spread of spam content. How do I avoid being labeled as a spammer? Post authentic content into communities where you have a personal interest. If your contributions to Reddit consist primarily of links to a business that you run, own, or otherwise benefit from, tread carefully, or consider advertising opportunities using our self-serve platform . If you\u2019re unsure if your content is considered spammy or unwelcome, contact the moderators of the community to which you\u2019d like to submit. Subreddits may have community-specific rules in addition to the guidelines below. The following are examples of behavior that may be considered spam and are subject to removal/ban: Sending large amounts of private messages to users who are not expecting them. Repeatedly posting the same or similar comments in a thread, subreddit or across subreddits. Repeatedly posting unrelated/off-topic/link-farmed content. Posting content that includes link redirects as a way to circumvent an existing domain block and/or to disguise a link\u2019s source (excluding subreddit sidebars). Linking to harmful third-party content, such as malware, phishing, deceptive pop-ups, etc. Programming bots that harm/break Reddit, including bots intended to promote content/products/services. To report spam, please visit this page . Please note: You will receive an auto-response when submitting a spam related report. A human reviews each ticket, but we will only respond when we need more information.",
    "vote manipulation": "Vote manipulation is prohibited on Reddit and goes against the rules, whether it is manual, programmatic, or otherwise. Some common forms of vote manipulation include: Using multiple accounts and voting services: Creating and employing multiple accounts, voting services, or any software to manipulate vote counts by either increasing or decreasing them. Soliciting votes: Requesting or encouraging people to upvote or downvote specific posts, either on Reddit or through social networks, messaging, etc. for personal gain. Participating in Group Voting: Joining or forming groups that coordinate votes, either on a specific post, a user's posts, content from a domain, etc. Engaging in vote cheating or manipulation will result in temporary or permanent banning of your Reddit account. If you come across instances of vote manipulation that you'd like to report, please visit this page .",
    "personal or confidential information": "No. Reddit is quite\u00a0open and pro-free speech, but it is not okay to post someone's personal information or post links to personal information. This includes links to public Facebook pages and screenshots of Facebook pages with the names still legible. Posting someone's personal information will\u00a0get you banned. When posting screenshots, be sure to edit out any personally identifiable information to avoid running afoul of this rule. Public figures can be an exception to this rule, such as posting professional links to contact a congressman or the CEO of a\u00a0company. But don't post anything inviting harassment, don't harass, and don't cheer on or upvote obvious vigilantism. To report a Personal Information violation, please visit this page .",
    "intimate or sexually-explicit media": "Respecting the privacy of others means being mindful of the impact of posting someone\u2019s picture or video. In particular, you can cause serious harm when posting something that was shared in private and wasn\u2019t ever intended to be shared in public. Rule 3 prohibits sharing intimate or sexually explicit media of a person created or posted without their permission. Intimate media include a depiction of the person in a state of nudity or engaged in any act of sexual conduct , including depictions that may have been AI-generated or faked. Images or video of intimate parts of a person's body, even if the person is clothed or in public , if contextualized in a salacious manner (e.g., \"creepshots\" or \"upskirt\" imagery), are also prohibited. The Rule applies to leaked, stolen or privately-shared images of an individual where the individual, or their representative, reports that they do not consent to the public sharing of the images. Additionally, images or video of another person posted for the specific purpose of faking explicit content or soliciting \u201clookalike\u201d pornography (e.g. \u201cdeepfakes\u201d or \"bubble porn\") is also against the Rule. Some examples that violate the Rule: Private sexting photos reshared with anyone other than the intended recipient, regardless of whether there was an intent to humiliate, intimidate, or to violate the person\u2019s privacy. Topless image of someone sunbathing in their garden, apparently taken without their awareness. Accidental nip-slip moment of a person in public caught on camera. Sharing nude shots of a famous model taken with their consent if they indicate they do not want those images shared publicly. Offering or soliciting stolen intimate or sexually explicit images of somebody. Note that the rule does not apply to media distributed commercially with the consent of those depicted, AI-generated sexual media that depicts fictional people or characters, or artistic depictions (e.g., cartoons, anime, etc.) \u2013 although keep in mind our rules regarding respecting the intellectual property of others. To report non-consensual intimate media, you can use the inline report feature on the app or website, or you can visit this page . If somebody has shared intimate images of you or somebody you know, click here for more information and support.",
    "sexual": "Reddit prohibits any sexual or suggestive content, and predatory or inappropriate behavior, involving minors (i.e., people under 18 years old) or someone who appears to be a minor. This includes sharing, offering, or asking for child sexual exploitation content, including child sexual abuse material (CSAM). CSAM can be defined as a visual depiction of sexually explicit conduct involving a minor, including the display of a child\u2019s nude body part in a sexual way. This prohibition applies even if the content is self-generated by a minor, shared with other minors, or reshared to criticize or denounce its existence. We report CSAM to the appropriate authorities and have active partnerships and collaborations with others in the industry, as well as organizations such as the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC). We also use industry-standard technologies to help us detect known illegal content that users attempt to share on the platform. We generally prohibit fantasy or fictional content (e.g. stories, deepfakes, photoshopped media) that depicts, encourages, or normalizes child sexual exploitation, sexual interest in children, or otherwise sexualizes minors \u2013although an exception may be made for genuine artistic expression that does not encourage or normalize the sexualization of children (for example, representations from popular movies, TV shows, paintings, etc.). Depending on the context, sexualization of minors can also include depictions of minors that are fully clothed and not engaged in explicit sexual acts. Here's a non-exhaustive list of examples that violate this policy: A cartoon depiction of a prepubescent child engaged in a sexual act A comment sexualizing a non-sexual image or video of a minor A community sexualizing a celebrity who is younger than 18 y.o., or was younger than 18 y.o. in the content depicted A post encouraging or advocating to normalize paedophilia as a socially acceptable sexual orientation Soliciting or offering \"nudes\" of minors, whether the poster is an adult or a minor If you are unsure about a piece of content involving a minor, do not share it. Additionally, any form of predatory or inappropriate behavior involving a minor is strictly prohibited. This may include a variety of interactions such as asking a minor to engage in sexual conversations, asking a minor to produce or share nude or suggestive images of themselves (which qualifies at CSAM solicitation), an adult attempting to meet with a minor in real life, or engaging in sexual role-play where an adult might assume the role of a minor. Using Reddit to facilitate inappropriate interactions with minors on other platforms, websites or via electronic devices is also prohibited. Here's a non-exhaustive list of examples that violate this policy: Direct messaging nude or sexually-explicit images or videos to a minor Threatening a minor if they don't share nude images An adult engaging a minor in sexually explicit conversation An adult requesting an intimate or sexual encounter off platform with a minor An exchange between an adult and a minor that may include a combination of flattery, offers of gifts, or requests for personal information or to meet privately online or in real life We enforce Rule 4 against a range of harmful content and behaviors. Some of our prohibitions go above and beyond legally-defined requirements.\u00a0 However, in some cases, we do rely on contextual information or signals from the community to determine the inappropriate nature of the content or behaviors. We also recognize that child sexual exploitation and related topics may be discussed in the context of news stories, societal concern, or preventative education, and we may allow this discourse to happen as long as it does not violate the letter or spirit of the prohibitions listed above. To report sexual or suggestive content or inappropriate behavior involving minors, you can use the in-line report feature on the app or website, or you can visit this page . You can also submit a report here if you don't have a Reddit account.",
    "abusive": "There is no excuse for the maltreatment of minors, be it physical, emotional, or sexual abuse, or severe neglect \u2013 depictions of this type of abuse are not allowed on Reddit. This Rule extends to depictions of the aftermath of abuse resulting in the death or serious injury of a minor. Here's a non-exhaustive list of examples that violate this policy: A video of a teacher beating a child in class A depiction of a minor made to sleep in a cage or in unsanitary conditions A video depicting the bullying or humiliation of a minor or making them perform degrading acts A video of someone encouraging or forcing a child to use drugs, ingest a dangerous substance or engage in a dangerous challenge A subreddit, post or comment encouraging or celebrating the corporal punishment of children A post promoting or encouraging child malnutrition or starvation as a form of punishment An image or video of a child physically restrained and visibly in distress An image of a child with visible bruising or physical injuries, posted without context, or when the context justifies maltreatment It is important to note that this Rule does not prohibit conversations about maltreatment in which survivors of abuse or concerned community members are discussing their experience or seeking help. Similarly, if the content is clearly newsworthy or the context of its posting is deemed relevant to the public interest (e.g. a teacher denouncing abuse practices normalized at their school), we will evaluate if the Rule applies on a case-by-case basis. However, as a rule of thumb, if the content depicts the abuse of a child without any context \u2013 or the context is malicious or insufficient \u2013 we will apply a zero tolerance approach. We ask that you bear that in mind when posting. To report abuse content involving minors, you can use the inline report feature on the app or website, or you can visit this page . You can also submit a report here if you don't have a Reddit account.",
    "impersonate": "Reddit does not allow content that impersonates individuals or entities in a misleading or deceptive manner. This not only includes using a Reddit account to impersonate someone, but also encompasses things such as domains that mimic others, as well as deepfakes or other manipulated content presented to mislead, or falsely attributed to an individual or entity. While we permit satire and parody, we will always take into account the context of any particular content. If you are being impersonated, or if you believe you\u2019ve found content in violation of these guidelines, please report it here .",
    "illegal or prohibited transactions": "Content is prohibited if it uses Reddit to solicit or facilitate any transaction or gift involving certain goods and services. You may not use Reddit to solicit or facilitate any transaction or gift involving certain goods and services, including Firearms, ammunition ,\u00a0explosives, legally controlled firearms parts or accessories (e.g., bump stock-type devices, silencers/suppressors, etc.),\u00a0or 3D printing files to produce any of the aforementioned; Drugs, including alcohol and tobacco, or any controlled substances (except advertisements placed in accordance with our advertising policy ); Paid services involving physical sexual contact; Stolen goods; Personal information; Falsified official documents or currency; Fraudulent services When considering a gift or transaction of goods or services not prohibited by this policy, keep in mind that Reddit is not intended to be used as a marketplace and takes no responsibility for any transactions individual users might decide to undertake in spite of this. Always remember: you are dealing with strangers on the internet.",
    "break the site": "Don't break the site or do anything that interferes with normal use of the site. Do not interrupt the serving of reddit, introduce malicious code onto reddit, make it difficult for anyone else to use reddit due to your actions, block sponsored headlines, create programs that violate any of our other API rules, or assist anyone in misusing reddit in any way.",
    "Quarantining": "Quarantined communities On a platform as open and diverse as Reddit, there will sometimes be communities that, while not prohibited, average redditors may nevertheless find highly offensive or upsetting. In other cases, communities may be dedicated to promoting hoaxes (yes we used that word) that warrant additional scrutiny, as there are some things that are either verifiable or falsifiable and not seriously up for debate. In these circumstances, Reddit Administrators may apply a quarantine. The purpose of quarantining a community is to prevent its content from being accidentally viewed by those who do not knowingly wish to do so, or viewed without appropriate context. Quarantined subreddits and their subscribers are still fully obliged to abide by Reddit\u2019s Content Policy and remain subject to enforcement measures. Quarantined communities will display a warning that requires users to explicitly opt-in to viewing the content. They generate no revenue, do not appear in non-subscription-based feeds (eg Popular), and are not included in search or recommendations. Reddit may also enforce a number of additional product restrictions that exist currently or as they may develop in the future (eg removing custom styling tools). Moderators will be notified via modmail if their community has been placed in quarantine. Appealing a Quarantine To be removed from quarantine, subreddit moderators may present an appeal here . The appeal should include a detailed accounting of changes to community moderation practices. (Appropriate changes may vary from community to community and could include techniques such as adding more moderators, creating new rules, employing more aggressive auto-moderation tools, adjusting community styling, etc.) The appeal should also offer evidence of sustained, consistent enforcement of these changes over a period of at least one month, demonstrating meaningful reform of the community. Moderators should only submit credible appeals that are supported by notable and sustained community transformation. Moderators are encouraged to take the time they need to craft a successful appeal.",
